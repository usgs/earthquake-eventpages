    By contributing your experience of the earthquake, either immediately
    afterward, or whenever it is possible for you to do so, you make a
    contribution to the scientific body of information about each earthquake.
    You also ensure that your area has been represented in the compilation of
    the maps of shaking. This is a two-way street: not only will you add
    valuable information on the extent of ground shaking and damage, but in the
    process we hope you will learn more about how other communities fared and
    gain a greater understanding of the effects of earthquakes.
