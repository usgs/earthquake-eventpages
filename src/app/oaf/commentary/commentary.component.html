        More earthquakes than usual (called aftershocks) will continue
        to occur near the mainshock.

        When there are more earthquakes, the chance of a large earthquake
        is greater which means that the chance of damage is greater.

        The USGS advises everyone to be aware of the possibility of
        aftershocks, especially when in or around vulnerable structures

      Magnitude 3 and above are large enough to be felt near the epicenter.
      The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large
      aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily.

        No one can predict the exact time or place of any earthquake,
        including aftershocks. Our earthquake forecasts give us an
        understanding of the chances of having more earthquakes within a
        given time period in the affected area. We calculate this
        earthquake forecast using a statistical analysis based on
        past earthquakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our forecast changes as time passes due to decline in the frequency
        of aftershocks, larger aftershocks that may trigger further
        earthquakes, and changes in forecast modeling based on the data
        collected for this earthquake sequence.
